# Introduction
- Briefly explain the VOC
- Research question
- Literature review
- Dataset interpretation
- Briefly introduce the methodology that we are going to use

# Data Check
- Consistent data might be helpful for analysis 
- Might consider more representative variabels

# Exploratory Data Analysis
- Not a distinguish negative coefficient between vocational training and union density

# Methodology and Result

### Replicate Original Model
- Get the same coefficient
- Model validation

### Transformation
- Use CrPlots to determin which variable to take log transformation
- Model validation

### Partial Correlation

### Mediation Analysis

# Conclusion
